**Chromite Nuggets** (found in six colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple) can be obtained by mining Chromite Ore (a sandstone variant found in the desert), with a chance to get 1-3 colors and 1-4 nuggets of each color.  They can be combined in a Crafting Table (no specific patter required) to make Raw Polychromite.  This can be smelted into a Dull Polychromite Ingot, which can be combined with a Glow Inc Sac in a Crafting Table to create a Polychromite Ingot.  Polychromite-Infused Sand has a chance to replace sand in the Desert, and will drop 1-4 Polychromite Dust.  Putting four Polychromite Dust in the crafting table creates a Polychromite Ingot.
 
**_There is a reason these are so difficult to obtain - They can be used to create the best gear in the game._** 
 
**Polychromite Upgrades** (smithing templates) can rarely be found in Desert Pyramids.  They can be duplicated by surrounding themselves with Polychromite Ingots and a Block of Obsidian in a crafting table. Its usages are listed below:
 
Polychromite Upgrade + Polychromite Ingot + Ender Pearl = **Polychromite Pearl** (an Ender Pearl enchanted with Infinity that has a 2.5% chance of breaking each time you use it)
 
Polychromite Upgrade + Polychromite Ingot + Totem of Undying = **Polychromite Totem** (A Totem of Undying with four uses)
 
Polychromite Upgrade + Polychromite Ingot + Bundle = **Polychromite Sack** (Transportable storage similar to a Shulker Box, however it can be opened from the inventory by right-clicking it in your main hand)
 
Polychromite Upgrade + Polychromite Ingot + Enchanted Golden Apple = **Enchanted Polychromite Apple** (An Enchanted Golden Apple but all of the status effects (except for Fire Res) have been amplified by one)
 
 
 
**_Additionally, there are a few Polychromite Crafting Recipes & Blocks:_** 

A Polychromite Upgrade in the center of the grid with a Polychromite Ingot in each corner and a Netherite Pickaxe on top, A Netherite Axe to the left, a Netherite Shovel to the right, and a Netherite Hoe on the bottom creates a **Polychromite Paxel** - a new tool that has the speed of a Netherite tool on any block it mines.  It can be enchanted using Anvils or Enchantment Tables.
 
A **Polychromite Platter** is a new food item that restores 15 Hunger Points (7.5 Drumstick Icons).  It can be crafted on a Crafting Table by putting a Bowl in the bottom center slot, Sweet Berries in the middle, Cooked Cod to the left of the berries, a Golden Carrot to the right of the berries, and Polychromite Dust above the Sweet Berries.
 
**Polychromite-Infused Sand** can be found generating in patches replacing sand in the desert.  It drops 1 sand and 1-4 Polychromite Dust (exceptions apply).  can be crafted by putting Polychromite Dust on the top, bottom, left and right of Sand in a Crafting Table.

**Polychromite Ore** can be found in the desert replacing sandstone.  It drops up to 4 colors of Chromite Nuggets, and up to 4 of each colour.  It cannot be crafted.
 
There is also a new Enchantment that you can apply to Mining Tools (Paxels included) called "**Condensing**".  This enchantment converts Polychromite Ore drops to Raw Polychromite and converts Polychromite-Infused Sand drops to a Chromite Ingot (It auto-crafts and condenses your ore drops and also gives you slightly more resources).
 
Thank you for reading this!  I hope that you can have a lot of fun with this mod!  Enjoy!
